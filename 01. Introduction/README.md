# Introduction - What is docker

Docker is an open-source platform that enables us to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. With Docker, you can separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

Consider a scenario where you have developed a Machine Learning model on your local machine and now you want the same model to run on a different machine. Usually, you would face a lot of difficulties because of differences in computing environments, such as different operating system, different library versions, different software configurations, etc. But if you use Docker, you can put your Machine Learning model into a Docker container which includes all necessary dependencies required by the model to run, and then you can run this Docker container on any machine where Docker is installed.

Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, known as a Docker image. This Docker image will run the exact same way regardless of the environment it is running in.
