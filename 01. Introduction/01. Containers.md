# Containers

## What are containers?

Imagine a tiny computer, very lightweight, that developers can use to bundle, transport, and use their software programs. These mini-computers, called 'containers', can function on various systems and ensure the software stays stable, regardless of where it's used.

Unlike traditional virtual systems that mimic an entire computer system, containers do something different. They share the operating system of the main computer they're on and create small zones where individual processes can run in a secluded way. This approach has some fab benefits:

* No Waste: Containers are small since they donâ€™t carry unnecessary extras and they can share elements. This means you can have more containers on one computer compared to having many individual virtual machines.
* Easy to transport: Containers carry an application and all its requirements. So, they can be taken and used anywhere.
* Quick to start: Containers don't need to start a complete operating system; thus, they boot up quicker than a typical virtual machine.
* Exact replicas: Containers supply a stable environment for developing, testing, and using applications, avoiding the issue of an application working on one system but not on another.

If you have worked on complex Machine Learning (ML) applications, you'll know how long it can take to set up the system and dependencies. Containers can help you avoid this. You can build a container with all the dependencies and share it with your team so everyone can use the same system without needing to set it up themselves.

## So what role does docker play here?

Docker is a handy tool that simplifies working with containers. Think of Docker as a toolbox for creating, delivering, and managing containers. It allows developers to bundle up all parts of an application (code, libraries, etc.) into a 'box' (container image), send it to any location, and trust that it will function in the same predictable way.

To summarize, containers do the following:

* Provide a Consistent Environment: Containers ensure that the application operates the same way on every system, facilitating collaboration.
* Use Resources Efficiently: Containers are small and share the resources of the main computer, meaning you can run more containers on a single computer compared to virtual machines.
* Enable Quick Deployment: Containers start and stop fast, making them ideal for applications that need quick scaling.

In sum, containers have become a vital tool for companies wishing to quickly adapt to market changes, improve resource use, and guarantee reliable software delivery. They've transformed modern software development and have a significant influence in the area of deployment and software management.
